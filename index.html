            <h2 id="About">About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Tim H&ouml;pfner, and I was born in 1996 in Kiel, Germany, where I spent the first years of my life until I moved to Kassel, where I attended school.
                There, I graduated from the Wilhelmsgymnasium Kassel with Abitur (german high school diploma).
                Afterwards, I moved to G&ouml;ttingen to study mathematics at the Georg-August-Universit&aumlt G&ouml;ttingen from 2014 until 2023, obtaining my Bachelor, Master and Dr. rer. nat. (PhD) in pure mathematics.

                My main research interest lies inbetween the fields of topology and differential geometry, though I am curious to learn about all mathematics that I encounter.

                During my time as a doctoral student from 2019 until 2023, I was lucky to be part of the Research Training Group "<a href="https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/607635.html">RTG 2491 - Fourier Analysis and Spectral Theory</a>" as an associated member,
                allowing me to work and study with many excellent young researchers coming to G&ouml;ttingen from all around the world and working many areas of mathematics.
                Furthermore, I was able to teach several courses at G&ouml;ttingen as an lecture assistant. In total I taught mathematics to around 1000 students over seven courses. 
                <br />

                In my free time, I love to solve analytic problems. For example, I'm an avid chess player and a fan of many other competitive strategy games.
                I also enjoy playing tennis and I play the guitar.

            <h4>The Problem of Heat Diffusion on Finite Spaces</h4>
            <p>
                Let us say we have a small space fitting into a box of finite size, such as the torus on the left hand side.
                On this torus, we can measure the temperature right now.
                How will this temperature change over time as we wait?
                Intuitively it is relatively clear, that the heat should spread out evenly, until we have the same temperature everywhere.
                We can use the so called heat equation from physics to simulate this process.
                The heat equation is a partial differential equation, \(\partial_t f(x,t) = -\Delta_x f(x,t)\),
                that is completely described by the Laplace operator \(\Delta_x\), which plays a central role in mathematics and physics.
                Using this equation, we can simulate our problem of heat diffusion.<br />

                With the magic of Fourier analysis and the Fourier transform,
                we can actually solve this heat equation to predict precisely how the heat will behave at any point of time in the future.
                Mathematically speaking, if we start out with heat \(g(x)\) at place \(x\) right now,
                then we can find a function \(f(x,t)\) giving us the temperature at \(x\) after time \(t\) using the heat operator: \(f(x,t) = e^{-t\Delta_x}g(x)\).
                This also tells us, how quickly the heat will spread out towards the uniform distribution of heat.
                The differences in temperature will decrease exponentially fast, that is according to an exponential function \(Ce^{-t\lambda_1}\).
                How fast this exponential decay is, is governed by the extra parameter \(\lambda_1>0\).

        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container-research">
        <div>
            <h4>What can we say about \(\lambda_1\)?</h4>
            <p>
                Naturally, we would like to learn more about this parameter \(\lambda_1\).
                Our mathematical appreach using the heat operator \(e^{-t\Delta_x}\) tells us, that \(\lambda_1\) and this operator should be connected.
                Indeed, for such an operator in mathematics, many of its important properties are captured by the so-called spectrum of the operator.
                For the Laplace operator here, the spectrum is a sequence of non-negative real numbers,
                \[\sigma(\Delta_x) = \lbrace 0 &lt; \lambda_1\leq \lambda_2\leq \lambda_3\leq \cdots \rbrace,\]
                and it is the smallest number besides zero that gives us the value we are looking for. <br />

                But we shouldn't forget that we are studying a problem coming from physics!
                After all, this parameter \(\lambda_1\) should be larger, if heat spreads out faster in our space.
                Thinking about when this happens can lead us to new descriptions of our parameter.

                <div class="container-research">

                        <ul style="padding-right:20px;">

                                <b>Geometry:</b> If it is easy to cut our space into two halfs of roughly equal size at some very thin part,
                                then this means that heat will take a very long time to travel from one side to the other.
                                It should therefore take longer for heat to spread out and hence \(\lambda_1\) should be smaller.
                                Indeed, J. Cheeger defined the so-called Cheeger constant \(h\), that measures how easy the cutting above is,
                                and there are very nice relations between \(h\) and \(\lambda_1\).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Stochastics:</b> Heat energy is nothing but kinetic energy of atoms. So heat spreads out simply because atoms travel through space.
                                The way atoms move seems random, but we can study it as a stochastic process, called Brownian motion.
                                Due to the randomness, just by chance atoms will spread out evenly over time.
                                The time it takes for our atoms to spread out over time should be directly connected to how long it takes our heat to spread out, and indeed, it is.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Graph Theory:</b> Studying atoms is quite hard, because it is a continuous problem: They can be at infinitely many places in space.
                                Luckily, it turns out that we can model Brownian motions very well by a discrete analogue: Random walks on graphs.
                                There are a lot easier to study using tools of discrete mathematics and especially graph theory.
                                Again, there are quantaties we can find here that relate directly to our mysterious parameter \(\lambda_1\).

            <h4>What about infinite spaces?</h4>
            <p>
                So on finite spaces, we understand quite well what happens.
                But what changes, if we look at infinite spaces?
                Mathematically, things become a lot more complicated.
                Recall that our key object of interest turned out to be the parameter \(\lambda_1\),
                which we could find as the smallest non-zero value in the spectrum of the Laplace operator.
                This made sense, because the spectrum was just a sequence of non-decreasing real numbers, so we just had to look for the first one.
                For infinite spaces, we can still study the Laplace operator, however, unfortunately it turns out that the spectrum is usually a lot more complicated.
                For example, it might just contain all non-negative real numbers.
                Then we don't have a smallest non-zero value in this spectrum anymore.
                In this case, the only reasonable choice for our parameter seems to be \(\lambda_1=0\).
                But then we would predict that our heat decays as fast as \(Ce^{-t\cdot 0} = C\) decays, but that is just constant - so this doesn't seem to make sense...<br />
                The point is that our heat decay might no longer be exponential at all.
                It might be a lot slower.
                I am mainly interested in the case where it is of polynomial speed, decaying as fast as \(Ct^{-\alpha}\), where we now have a new parameter \(\alpha>0\).
                Instead of \(\lambda_1\) from before, our goal is now to understand how to find this parameter \(\alpha=\alpha_0\), called the zeroth Novikov-Shubin invariant.
                This poses a lot more delicate problem, and many new obstacles await along the way.
                It turns out that this zeroth Novikov-Shubin invariant we understand to some extend, due to results by Varopoulos that again uses random walks to study this problem.
                But it also turns out, that there are higher Novikov-Shubin invariants that are equally interesting to study but even less approachable.
                The content of my PhD thesis deals with the problem of computing these Novikov-Shubin invariants.

            <h4>So let's talk math! What did I do?</h4>
            <p>
                If we study the heat problem on an infinite space, meaning a non-compact manifold \(M\),
                we again consider the Laplace operator \(\Delta_0\) acting on the \(L^2\)-functions on \(M\),
                but also the higher Laplace operators \(\Delta_k\) acting on the \(L^2\)-\(k\)-forms on \(M\).
                We are interested in the case, where the spectrum \(\sigma(\Delta_k)\),
                which by self-adjointness and non-negativity of \(\Delta_k\) is contained in the non-negative real numbers,
                contains arbitrarily small values \(\varepsilon>0\).
                In this case, we want to measure how large the subspace of \(L^2\)-\(k\)-forms is, on which \(\Delta_k\) scales with a factor at most some factor \(\lambda>0\).
                As a vector space, this is infinite dimensional, so we need some extra symmetries.
                However, if we assume these, we can define a function \(F_k(\lambda)=\textrm{size of this subspace}\), called the spectral density function.
                If
                \[F(\lambda)-F(0) \sim \lambda^{\alpha_k} \qquad \textrm{as } \lambda\searrow 0,\]
                this formally (ok, not quite formally but close!) defines the \(k\)th Novikov-Shubin invariant of \(M\).
                These invariants still tell us a lot about heat-related questions on \(M\), in fact, \(\alpha_0\) is indeed the same as the \(\alpha_0\) from before (up to a factor of 2).
                They are called invariants because they are indeed homotopy invariants of \(M\), making them a very interesting object to study.
                The problem is that their definition in terms of spectral properties of \(\Delta_k\) is not very useful when we want to compute them (it's very hard to do so...).
                So we would like to find new approaches.

            <h4> Approach 1: Stochastics </h4>
            <p>
                If our manifold is a nice CW complex, iteratively build up by disks of increasing dimensions, we can use the combinatorial data coming from this construction to approach the computation.
                For \(\alpha_0\), we have to understand how 1-disks (i.e., intervals) are attached to 0-disks (i.e., vertices).
                This so-called 1-skeleton of \(M\) is therefore nothing but a graph.
                A wonderful result by Varopoulos tells us, that we can compute \(\alpha_0\) in terms of the return probability of a random walk on this graph.
                In my thesis, I show that there are higher-dimensional analogues of these random walks, that relate to the higher \(\alpha_k\).
                These random walks take place on the \(k\)-dimensinal disks in our manifold.
                Contrary to vertices however, these disks can be oriented in two different ways.
                This leads to a more complicated random walk, where random walkers can move to every \(k\)-disk with either of the two orientations.
                And, if two random walkers meet at the same disk but with opposite orientations, they cancel each other out - not unsimilar to the cancelations between particles and anti-particles in physics.
                I explicitly describe these random walks and their relation to the higher Novikov-Shubin invariants, establishing a new approach to studying Novikov-Shubin invariants using stochastical methods.

            <h4> Approach 2: Computer Estimations </h4>
            <p>
                Another approach to computing these invariants is a result by Rumin, who developed a way of computing estimates on Novikov-Shubin invariants in some situations.
                Simplifying this result a bit further, I implemented this approach as a python program to compute estimates for all nilpotent Lie groups up to dimension six.
                This gives us quite a few new estimates on Novikov-Shubin invariants, but unfortunately, it turns out that the approach often fails and cannot give any bounds on the invariants.
                In order to understand the short-comings further, we move on to the third approach.

            <h4> Approach 3: Differential Geometry </h4>
            <p>
                Based on the method behind the proof of Rumin's result, I defined a new, more detailed version of Novikov-Shubin invariants.
                The basic idea is the following observation: If we look at how heat spread out through space, we get the same result by waiting twice as long as we get from scaling all distances in our manifold by a factor 1/2.
                We consider now spaces with multiple directions, so-called fibre bundles.
                In these spaces, we can start to scale different directions at different speeds and study how heat behaves on these scaled spaces.
                This tells us something about the contributions that the different directions have towards the Novikov-Shubin invariants of our space. <br />
                Defining these new invariants depends, a priori, on quite a bit of extra structure needed to talk about these different directions.
                I show that the resulting numbers are indeed invariant under many of these choices. <br />
                Then, I computed these new invariants for the 3-dimensional Heisenberg group, which is the three-dimensional Lie group with generators \(X,Y,Z\) and only non-zero commutator relation  \([X,Y]=Z\).
                If we scale the base directions \(X,Y\) with speed \(\lambda\) and vary the scaling speed of the fibre direction \(Z\) as \(\lambda^{1+\zeta}\) according to some parameter \(\zeta\), we find the graph on the left.
                Surprisingly, the contribution from the fibre direction seems to have opposing effects on the zeroth and the first Novikov-Shubin invariants´.

    <h3>Master Thesis - "The Mayer-Vietoris Spectral Sequence for Coarse Generalized Homology"</h3>
    <div class="container-research">
        <div class="caption">
            <p>
                In my Master Thesis, I studied coarse geometry. Here, we are interested in the large-scale properties of spaces - in contrast to topology, studying the small-scale structure.
                In algebraic topology, we like to define invariants to describe and compare our spaces, that is, numbers or other simple objects.
                If we are able to compute these invariants easily, we can (sometimes) use them to figure out whether two spaces are different.
                In topology, one of the most classical type of invariants are homology theories.
                One important tool to compute these is the Mayer-Vietoris sequence.
                Given a complicated space, we can cut it into two smaller pieces.
                If we understand each of the pieces and their intersection, we can recover the information of the total space.
                Of course, we can iterate this procedure and thereby cut our space in any finite number of pieces.
                The Mayer-Vietoris spectral sequence is a complex mathematical tool that takes this one step further, as it allows us to cut the space even into infinitely many pieces.
                <br />
                While all of this was known for a long time for topological spaces, for coarse spaces only the usual Mayer-Vietoris sequence was known.
                A previous result indicated, that also the infinite version should hold, however, in my thesis I point out that this previous result is flawed.
                While I establish a spectral sequence for easier computations for finite decomposition, I show that such an infinite decomposition cannot be used to compute coarse homology from infinite decompositions.
                I also give an explicit counterexample to show precisely, why this argument fails.

                In my Bachelor thesis, I studied the problem of motion planning from a point of view of topology ("Topological Complexity"):
                <br />
                Let's say we have an empty stace with arbitrarily many (moving and non-moving) obstacles and any number of agents (e.g., robots) that need to move around freely without colliding with the obstacles or other agents.
                I describe explicitely a (topological) algorithm that considers the current location and the target position of each of the agents and produces for each agent a path that they can move along.
