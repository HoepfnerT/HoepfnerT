                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello there! My name is Tim Höpfner, and I'm delighted to share a little about myself with you.
                    I was born in the Kiel, located in the beautiful north of Germany at the baltic sea, back in 1996.
                    As a young child, I spent my early years there before my family relocated to Kassel, where I attended school.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I completed my schooling at the Wilhelmsgymnasium Kassel, where I successfully obtained my Abitur, the German high school diploma.
                    During my time there, I developed a strong passion for natural sciences and especially mathematics, which led me to pursue further academic endeavors at the esteemed Georg-August-Universität Göttingen.
                </p>

                <p>
                    From 2014 to 2023, I fully immersed myself in the captivating realm of mathematics at Göttingen.
                    I successfully earned my Bachelor's and Master's degrees, and I'm currently on the verge of completing my Doctorate (Dr. rer. nat.).
                    Throughout my academic journey, my focus has primarily been on the intersection of topology and differential geometry, subjects that have continually piqued my interest.
                    However, I've always maintained an insatiable curiosity for all branches of mathematics that come my way.
                </p>

                <p>
                    During my time as a doctoral student, spanning from 2019 to 2023, I had the privilege of being an associated member of the
                    Research Training Group "<a href="https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/607635.html">RTG 2491 - Fourier Analysis and Spectral Theory</a>".
                    This incredible opportunity allowed me to collaborate with exceptional young researchers from diverse backgrounds, each bringing their own expertise to the vibrant mathematical community in Göttingen.
                    Additionally, I had the pleasure of sharing my knowledge by teaching numerous courses to over 1000 students, serving as a lecture assistant.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Beyond my academic pursuits, I find immense joy in solving intricate analytic problems.
                    Chess has always held a special place in my heart, providing endless fascination and a healthy dose of competition.
                    Moreover, I deeply appreciate various other strategic games that challenge my intellect, as well as engaging in social games and activities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me.
                    I'm eager to continue my journey, explore new horizons, and make meaningful contributions to the world of mathematics and beyond.
                    If you have any questions or would like to connect, please feel free to reach out.

                    <h4>The Problem of Heat Diffusion on Finite Spaces</h4>
                    <p>
                        Imagine we have a confined space, contained in a finite-sized box, like the torus on the left-hand side.
                        Within this space, we are able to measure the current temperature.
                        Then, a question arises naturally:
                        How will this temperature change over time as we wait?
                        <br />

                        Intuitively, it seems apparent that heat should gradually spread out evenly until we reach a state of equilibrium with the same temperature everywhere.
                        To simulate this process, we can turn to the heat equation from physics.
                        <br />

                        The heat equation, a partial differential equation given by the formula \(\partial_t f(x,t) = -\Delta_x f(x,t)\),
                        can be fully described by the Laplace operator \(\Delta_x\), which holds a crucial role in both mathematics and physics.
                        Utilizing this equation, we can simulate the diffusion of heat in our given problem.
                        <br />

                        Through the remarkable, magical concepts of Fourier analysis and the Fourier transform,
                        we can actually solve this heat equation,
                        enabling precise predictions of how heat will behave at any given point in the future.
                        Mathematically speaking, if we begin with an initial distribution of heat \(g(x)\)  at a location \(x\),
                        we can determine a function \(f(x,t)\) that provides the temperature at \(x\) after time \(t\) using the heat operator:
                        \(f(x,t) = e^{-t\Delta_x}g(x)\).
                        <br />

                        This solution not only informs us about the temperature at any point of space and time, but also reveals the speed at which heat spreads towards a uniform distribution.
                        The temperature differences will decrease exponentially fast, following an exponential function \(Ce^{-t\lambda_1}\).
                        The rate of this exponential decay is governed by an additional parameter \(\lambda_1>0\).

                    <h4>What can we say about \(\lambda_1\)?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Naturally, we would like to learn more about this parameter \(\lambda_1\).
                        Our mathematical approach reveals that this parameter and the operator are intricately linked. 
                        In fact, many essential properties of such operators in mathematics are captured by their spectrum.
                        In the case of the Laplace operator, the spectrum is a sequence of non-negative real numbers given by
                        \[\sigma(\Delta_x) = \lbrace 0 &lt; \lambda_1\leq \lambda_2\leq \lambda_3\leq \cdots \rbrace.\]
                        The parameter \(\lambda_1\) holds significance as it represents the smallest non-zero value in this sequence.
                        <br />

                        However, it is crucial to bear in mind that we are dealing with a problem rooted in physics.
                        After all, this parameter \(\lambda_1\) should be larger if heat spreads more rapidly in our space. 
                        By pondering under what circumstances this occurs, 
                        we can arrive at novel descriptions and insights regarding our parameter.

                                If our space can be easily divided into two halves of approximately equal size at a narrow section, 
                                heat will take a considerable amount of time to travel from one side to the other as it has to pass through this tight bottleneck.
                                Consequently, it will take longer for heat to spread out.
                                Therefore, \(\lambda_1\) should be smaller.
                                Indeed, J. Cheeger defined the so-called Cheeger constant \(h\) to measure the ease of such division,
                                and there are interesting connections between \(h\) and \(\lambda_1\).

                                Heat energy is essentially the kinetic energy of atoms,
                                and heat spreads due to the movement of atoms through space.
                                Although atom movement appears random, we can study it as a stochastic process known as Brownian motion.
                                Due to this randomness, atoms will eventually spread out uniformly over time.
                                The time it takes for atoms to disperse correlates directly with the time it takes for heat to spread,

                                Modeling the continuous problem of atom movement can be challenging since atoms can occupy infinitely many positions in space.
                                Fortunately, it has been discovered that discrete analogs, such as random walks on graphs,
                                provide an excellent representation of Brownian motion.
                                Studying these discrete models using tools from discrete mathematics, particularly graph theory,
                                offers valuable insights and quantities that relate directly to the elusive parameter  \(\lambda_1\).

                    <h4>What about infinite spaces?</h4>
                    <p>
                        When considering infinite spaces, the understanding of heat diffusion becomes significantly more intricate.
                        Mathematically, complexities arise due to the fact that our parameter of interest,
                        \(\lambda_1\),
                        which was previously determined as the smallest non-zero value in the spectrum of the Laplace operator,
                        undergoes changes. In the case of infinite spaces, the spectrum of the Laplace operator is usually far more complex.
                        For instance, it may encompass all non-negative real numbers, eliminating the existence of a smallest non-zero value.


                        In such scenarios, assigning \(\lambda_1=0\) seems to be the only reasonable choice.
                        However, this raises a puzzling issue:
                        If the heat were to decay at a rate of  \(Ce^{-t\cdot 0} = C\) , it would remain constant,
                        which contradicts our understanding.

                        The key realization is that heat decay in infinite spaces may not follow an exponential pattern at all;
                        instead, it can exhibit significantly slower rates.
                        Of particular interest to me is the case where heat decays at a polynomial speed, such as
                        \(Ct^{-\alpha}\),  introducing a new parameter \(\alpha>0\).
                        Thus, our objective now shifts towards comprehending how to determine the value of this parameter,
                        denoted as \(\alpha=\alpha_0\),
                        also known as the zeroth Novikov-Shubin invariant.

                        The determination of this zeroth Novikov-Shubin invariant is a considerably more delicate problem,
                        presenting numerous challenges along the way. While some understanding of this invariant has been achieved,
                        thanks to Varopoulos' results utilizing random walks,
                        higher Novikov-Shubin invariants also emerge as intriguing subjects of study,
                        yet they prove even more challenging to approach.

                        My PhD thesis revolves around the investigation of computing these Novikov-Shubin invariants, 
                        as they offer rich and complex avenues of exploration.

                    <h4>Understanding Heat Problems on Infinite Spaces</h4>
                    <p>
                        What happens, if we study the heat problem on an infinite space, meaning a non-compact manifold \(M\)?
                        Again, we consider the Laplace operator \(\Delta_0\) acting on the \(L^2\)-functions on \(M\),
                        but also the higher Laplace operators \(\Delta_k\) acting on the \(L^2\)-\(k\)-forms on \(M\).
                        As before, we are interested in the the spectrum \(\sigma(\Delta_k)\),
                        which by self-adjointness and non-negativity of \(\Delta_k\) is contained in the non-negative real numbers.
                        Based on what we saw before, the small values in the spectrum should tell us about the long-term asymptotic behaviour of heat.
                        However, it now might happen that the spectrum contains arbitrarily small values \(\varepsilon>0\).

                        In this case, we want to measure how large the subspace of \(L^2\)-\(k\)-forms is, on which \(\Delta_k\) scales with a factor at most some factor \(\lambda>0\).
                        As a vector space, this space will be infinite dimensional, so this is not a viable way of measuring size.
                        If we have extra structure coming from symmetries of our space, we might be able to take a different, more rough dimension.
                        If we assume these symmetries, we can define a function \(F_k(\lambda)=\textrm{size of this subspace}\), called the spectral density function.
                        If \(F_k(\lambda)\) approaches \(F_k(0)\) as \(\lambda\searrow 0\) as fast as the polynomial \(\lambda^{\alpha}\) converges to 0,
                        this formally (ok, not quite formally but close!) defines the \(k\)th Novikov-Shubin invariant of \(M\).
                        These invariants still tell us a lot about heat-related questions on \(M\). 
                        In fact, \(\alpha_0\) is indeed the same as the \(\alpha_0\) from before (up to a factor of 2).
                        They are called invariants because they are indeed homotopy invariants of \(M\), making them a very interesting object to study.
                        The problem is that their definition in terms of spectral properties of \(\Delta_k\) is not very useful when we want to compute them (it's very hard to do so...).
                        So we would like to find new approaches.

                    <h4> Approach 1: Stochastics </h4>
                    <p>
                        If our manifold can be constructed combinatorially by glueing together pieces of inceasing dimension,
                        that is \(M\) is a so-called CW complex, 
                        we can use the combinatorial data coming from this construction to approach the computation.
                        For \(\alpha_0\), we have to understand how 1-disks (i.e., intervals) are attached to 0-disks (i.e., vertices).
                        This so-called 1-skeleton of \(M\) is therefore nothing but a graph.
                        A wonderful result by Varopoulos tells us, that we can compute \(\alpha_0\) in terms of the return probability of a random walk on this graph.
                        In my thesis, I show that there are higher-dimensional analogues of these random walks, that relate to the higher \(\alpha_k\).
                        These random walks take place on the \(k\)-dimensinal disks in our manifold.
                        Contrary to vertices however, these disks can be oriented in two different ways.
                        This leads to a more complicated random walk, where random walkers can move to every \(k\)-disk with either of the two orientations.
                        And, if two random walkers meet at the same disk but with opposite orientations, they cancel each other out - not unsimilar to the cancelations between particles and anti-particles in physics.
                        I explicitly describe these random walks and their relation to the higher Novikov-Shubin invariants, establishing a new approach to studying Novikov-Shubin invariants using stochastical methods.

                    <p>
                        Another approach to computing these invariants is a result by Rumin, who developed a way of computing estimates on Novikov-Shubin invariants in some situations.
                        Simplifying this result a bit further, I implemented this approach as a python program to compute estimates for all nilpotent Lie groups up to dimension six.
                        This gives us quite a few new estimates on Novikov-Shubin invariants, but unfortunately, it turns out that the approach often fails and cannot give any bounds on the invariants.
                        In order to understand the short-comings further, we move on to the third approach.

                    <h4> Approach 3: Differential Geometry </h4>
                    <p>
                        Based on the method behind the proof of Rumin's result, I defined a new, more detailed version of Novikov-Shubin invariants.
                        The basic idea is the following observation: If we look at how heat spread out through space, we get the same result by waiting twice as long as we get from scaling all distances in our manifold by a factor 1/2.
                        We consider now spaces with multiple directions, so-called fibre bundles.
                        In these spaces, we can start to scale different directions at different speeds and study how heat behaves on these scaled spaces.
                        This tells us something about the contributions that the different directions have towards the Novikov-Shubin invariants of our space. <br />
                        Defining these new invariants depends, a priori, on quite a bit of extra structure needed to talk about these different directions.
                        I show that the resulting numbers are indeed invariant under many of these choices. <br />
                        Then, I computed these new invariants for the 3-dimensional Heisenberg group, which is the three-dimensional Lie group with generators \(X,Y,Z\) and only non-zero commutator relation  \([X,Y]=Z\).
                        If we scale the base directions \(X,Y\) with speed \(\lambda\) and vary the scaling speed of the fibre direction \(Z\) as \(\lambda^{1+\zeta}\) according to some parameter \(\zeta\), we find the graph on the left.
                        Surprisingly, the contribution from the fibre direction seems to have opposing effects on the zeroth and the first Novikov-Shubin invariants´.

                <h3>Master Thesis - "The Mayer-Vietoris Spectral Sequence for Coarse Generalized Homology"</h3>
                <p>
                    In my Master's thesis, 
                    I delved into the field of coarse geometry,
                    which focuses on understanding the large-scale properties of spaces, 
                    as opposed to studying their small-scale structure as in traditional topology.
                    In algebraic topology, 
                    we often seek to define invariants that describe and compare spaces using numbers or other simple objects. 
                    These invariants can be powerful tools for distinguishing between different spaces, 
                    provided we can compute them easily.
                    One of the most classical types of invariants in topology are homology theories.
                    They allow us to capture essential features of a space. To compute these invariants, 
                    we often rely on the Mayer-Vietoris sequence, which is an important mathematical tool. 
                    This sequence enables us to decompose a complex space into two smaller pieces 
                    and understand the information of the total space by examining each piece and their intersection.
                    We can apply this decomposition procedure iteratively, 
                    cutting our space into any finite number of pieces. 
                    However, the Mayer-Vietoris spectral sequence takes it a step further by allowing us to decompose the space into infinitely many pieces.
                    While this knowledge has been well-established for topological spaces, 
                    for coarse spaces, only the standard Mayer-Vietoris sequence was known. 
                    Previous research suggested that the infinite version of this sequence would also hold for coarse spaces. 
                    However, in my thesis, I uncovered a flaw in this previous result.
                    Although I established a spectral sequence for easier computations using finite decompositions, 
                    I demonstrated that such an infinite decomposition cannot be used to compute coarse homology accurately. 
                    To illustrate this limitation, I provided an explicit counterexample, 
                    highlighting precisely why the previous argument fails.

                <p>
                    In my Bachelor's thesis,
                    I investigated the challenging problem of motion planning from a topological standpoint.
                    Specifically, I focused on understanding "topological complexity" in motion planning scenarios.
                    <br />
                    Imagine an empty space filled with numerous obstacles, some of which are in motion, while others remain stationary.
                    Additionally, there are multiple agents, such as robots,
                    that need to navigate freely without colliding with any obstacles or each other.
                    To address this problem, I developed an explicit topological algorithm that takes into account the current location and target position of each agent.
                    The algorithm generates a path for each agent,
                    ensuring that they can move safely towards their respective targets.

                    Using principles from topology, which studies the properties of spaces preserved under continuous transformations, 
                    my algorithm offers a systematic approach to motion planning.

                <p>
                    As an avid chess enthusiast and player, I have developed a deep passion for the game.
                    While my recent focus has been on online play, I have a rich background in tournament chess.
                    During my youth, I achieved considerable success at the national level,
                    including my victory at the Hesse State Championship in 2008, in the under 12 age group.
                    Additionally, in 2012, I secured a commendable sixth place in the open part of the German National Championship under 25.
                    You can explore my FIDE profile for more details on my chess journey:
                    <a href="https://ratings.fide.com/profile/4638310/chart">FIDE profile</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I draw inspiration from remarkable chess players, particularly world champion Ding Liren and the talented Levon Aronian.
                    Among the countless memorable games, Nigel Short's triumphant encounter against Jan Timman in 1991 holds a special place in my heart.
                    It features one of the most beautiful and creative attacks in chess history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While chess holds a prominent position in my gaming repertoire,
                    I also derive great enjoyment from other competitive games.
                    For instance, I love engaging in thrilling matches of the card game Dominion or delving into the strategic world of Settlers of Catan, a captivating board game.
                    Of course, it's important to note that games serve not only as a platform for competition but also as a source of pure fun and entertainment.
                    I relish the social dynamics of board game evenings and cherish the immersive experiences offered by tabletop games like Dungeons & Dragons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My favorite mathematical puzzle is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_prisoners_problem">100 prisoners problem</a> 
                    <button id="btn-modal-prisoners">(show)</button>.
                    <dialog id="modal-prisoners">
                        <div style="width:50vw">
                            <p>
                                The director of a prison offers 100 death row prisoners,
                                who are numbered from 1 to 100, a last chance.
                                A room contains a cupboard with 100 drawers.
                                The director randomly puts one prisoner's number in each closed drawer.
                                The prisoners enter the room, one after another. Each prisoner may open and look into 50 drawers in any order.
                                The drawers are closed again afterwards. If, during this search, every prisoner finds their number in one of the drawers,
                                all prisoners are pardoned. If even one prisoner does not find their number, all prisoners die.
                                Before the first prisoner enters the room, the prisoners may discuss strategy — but may not communicate once the first prisoner enters to look in the drawers.
                                What is the prisoners' best strategy? <br />
                                (Version due to P. Flajolet and R. Sedgewick.)

                    Originally proposed by P. B. Miltersen as a problem with no good solution, it turns out that there is a surprising solution that seems to good to be true.
                    Working this out leads you on a surprising journey through the world of stochastics, discrete mathematics, graph theory and information theory.
                    This problem is also a great way to introduce people to research mathematics.
                    For example, I used this problem during the propaedeutic for all incoming students, working out the solution step by step with the pupils.
                    If you just want to see the solution, I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSNsgj1OCLA">this video by Veritasium on youtube</a>, though, have a go at it yourself first!
