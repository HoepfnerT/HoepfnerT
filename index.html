            <p>
                My name is Tim H&ouml;pfner, and I was born in 1996 in Kiel, Germany, where I spent the first years of my life until I moved to Kassel, where I attended school.
                There, I graduated from the Wilhelmsgymnasium Kassel with Abitur (german high school diploma).
                Afterwards, I moved to G&ouml;ttingen to study mathematics at the Georg-August-Universit&aumlt G&ouml;ttingen from 2014 until 2023, obtaining my Bachelor, Master and Dr. rer. nat. (PhD) in pure mathematics.

                My main research interest lies inbetween the fields of topology and differential geometry, though I am curious to learn about all mathematics that I encounter.
                <br />

                During my time as a doctoral student from 2019 until 2023, I was lucky to be part of the Research Training Group "RTG 2491 - Fourier Analysis and Spectral Theory" as an associated member,
                allowing me to work and study with many excellent young researchers from all around the world and many areas of mathematics.
                Furthermore, I was able to teach several courses at G&ouml;ttingen as an lecture assistant. In total I taught mathematics to around 1000 students over seven courses. Mainly, this includes students of mathematics, but also students of computer sciences, biology, geology and molecular medicine.

                <br />
                In my free time, I love to create (and sometimes solve) analytic problems. For example, I'm an avid chess player and a fan of many other competitive strategy games.
                I enjoy playing tennis and I play the guitar.

    <h3>PhD Thesis - "Novikov-Shubin Invariants of Nilpotent Lie Groups"</h3>

            In my PhD thesis, I studied the so-called Novikov-Shubin invariants.
            They describe the long-term asymptotic behaviour of the heat decay on infinite spaces.
            For finite spaces, such as the torus on the left, studying how heat evolves over time is a classic problem of physics.
            Indeed, for finite spaces, we know exactly how quickly the heat will spread out evenly.
            The speed is exponential,  \( e^{-t\lambda_1} \), according to an extra parameter \(\lambda_1>0\).
            This paramter appears in many areas of mathematics.<br>
            It is the smallest non-zero eigenvalue of the Laplace operator, one of the most important operators in geometry and phyics.
            Using the connection to the heat equation and physics, we can relate this paramter to other quantities.
            For example, we can give bounds on \(\lambda_1\) in terms of a geometric qunatity, called Cheeger's constant, that measures how easily we can cut our space into two pieces of roughly the same size.
            If this is easily possible, it is hard for heat to move from one side to the other.
            Indeed, then the heat diffuses more slowly and hence \(\lambda_1\) is smaller.
            Coming from a completely different point of view, we can recall that heat energy is nothing but kinetic energy of atoms.
            Hence, if we want to understand how heat travels through space, we should understand the same for atoms first.
            Physics tells us that atoms move according to a stochastic process called Brownian motion.
            The mixing time of such a Brownian motion measures how long it takes until atoms distribute evenly throughout the space.
            As this also means that the heat spreads out evenly, this mixing time is also related to \(\lambda_1\).
        </p>

    <div class="container-research">
        <p>
            On infinite spaces, the situation changes dramatically.
            It can happen that we still have exponential decay \( e^{-t\lambda_1} \), according to a lower bound on the spectrum of the Laplace operator.
            But it can also happen that no such lower bound exists and \(\lambda_1=0\) would be the only reasonable choice.
            However, since \( e^{-t\cdot 0} = 1 \) is constant, this does not make sense. Indeed, it turns out that sometimes exponential decay is no longer the right model.
            Instead, we see slower decay of heat.
            If the decay is polynomial according to some polynomial \(t^{-\alpha_0/2}\), we call this new, extra parameter \(\alpha_0\) the zeroth Novikov-Shubin invariant.
            This number is interesting, not only because it describes the heat decay but also because it again relates to many other important areas of mathematics.
            Indeed, it again measures spectral properties of the Laplace operator acting on functions.
            It measures, how much spectrum the operator has close to zero, which, for example, tells us something about invertibility of the Laplacian.
            Naturally, we can therefore consider this kind of invariant also for other operators, for example, the higher Laplace operators acting of differential forms of our manifold, defining higher Novikov-Shubin invariants \(\alpha_k\).
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container-research">
        <p>
            Classically, a result by N. Th. Varopoulos relates \(\alpha_0\) again to a stochastic quantity, the return probability of a random walk.
            I developed a framework in which we obtain a generalisation of this result for the higher Novikov-Shubin invariants.
            For this, I describe explicitly stochastic processes and their relation to the higher Laplace operators.
            Here, we want to assume that our spaces comes with a so-called CW structure, meaning that we can view it as being build iteratively from blocks of increasing dimension.
            The stochastic process relating to \(\alpha_k\) is a random walk, where the random walkers move around on the \(k\)-dimensional building blocks.
            Interestingly, these building blocks can have either of two different orientations.
            If two random walkers meet at the same block but with different orientations they cancel each other out, similar to how particles and anti-particles cancel out when they meet.
            This opens a new avenue of studying the Laplace operators as well as their Novikov-Shubin invariants from the world of stochastics.

    <h3>Master Thesis - "The Mayer-Vietoris Spectral Sequence for Coarse Generalized Homology"</h3>
    <div class="container-research">
        <div class="caption">
            <p>
                In my Master Thesis, I studied coarse geometry. Here, we are interested in the large-scale properties of spaces - in contrast to topology, studying the small-scale structure.
                In algebraic topology, we like to define invariants to describe and compare our spaces, that is, numbers or other simple objects.
                If we are able to compute these invariants easily, we can (sometimes) use them to figure out whether two spaces are different.
                In topology, one of the most classical type of invariants are homology theories.
                One important tool to compute these is the Mayer-Vietoris sequence.
                Given a complicated space, we can cut it into two smaller pieces.
                If we understand each of the pieces and their intersection, we can recover the information of the total space.
                Of course, we can iterate this procedure and thereby cut our space in any finite number of pieces.
                The Mayer-Vietoris spectral sequence is a complex mathematical tool that takes this one step further, as it allows us to cut the space even into infinitely many pieces.
                <br />
                While all of this was known for a long time for topological spaces, for coarse spaces only the usual Mayer-Vietoris sequence was known.
                A previous result indicated, that also the infinite version should hold, however, in my thesis I point out that this previous result is flawed.
                While I establish a spectral sequence for easier computations for finite decomposition, I show that such an infinite decomposition cannot be used to compute coarse homology from infinite decompositions.
                I also give an explicit counterexample to show precisely, why this argument fails.

                In my Bachelor thesis, I studied the problem of motion planning from a point of view of topology ("Topological Complexity"):
                <br />
                Let's say we have an empty stace with arbitrarily many (moving and non-moving) obstacles and any number of agents (e.g., robots) that need to move around freely without colliding with the obstacles or other agents.
                I describe explicitely a (topological) algorithm that considers the current location and the target position of each of the agents and produces for each agent a path that they can move along.
