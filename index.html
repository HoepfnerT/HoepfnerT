                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello there! My name is Tim Höpfner, and I'm delighted to share a little about myself with you.
                    I was born in Kiel, located in the beautiful north of Germany at the baltic sea, back in 1996.
                    As a young child, I spent my early years there before my family relocated to Kassel, where I attended school.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I completed my schooling at the Wilhelmsgymnasium Kassel, where I successfully obtained my Abitur, the German high school diploma.
                    During my time there, I developed a strong passion for natural sciences and especially mathematics, which led me to pursue further academic endeavors at the esteemed Georg-August-Universität Göttingen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From 2014 to 2023, I fully immersed myself in the captivating realm of mathematics at Göttingen.
                    Here, I successfully earned my Bachelor's and Master's degrees, and recently earned my Doctorate (Dr. rer. nat.).

            <p>
                Throughout my academic journey, my focus has primarily been on the intersection of topology and differential geometry, subjects that have continually piqued my interest.
                However, I've always maintained an insatiable curiosity for all branches of mathematics that come my way.
                During my time as a doctoral student, spanning from 2019 to 2023, I had the privilege of being an associated member of the
                Research Training Group "<a href="https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/607635.html">RTG 2491 - Fourier Analysis and Spectral Theory</a>".
                This incredible opportunity allowed me to collaborate with exceptional young researchers from diverse backgrounds, each bringing their own expertise to the vibrant mathematical community in Göttingen.
                Additionally, I had the pleasure of sharing my knowledge by teaching numerous courses to over 1000 students, serving as a lecture assistant.
            </p>

            <p>
                Beyond my academic pursuits, I find immense joy in solving intricate analytic problems.
                Chess has always held a special place in my heart, providing endless fascination and a healthy dose of competition.
                Moreover, I deeply appreciate various other strategic games that challenge my intellect, as well as engaging in social games and activities.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me.
                I'm eager to continue my journey, explore new horizons, and make meaningful contributions to the world of mathematics and beyond.
                If you have any questions or would like to connect, please feel free to reach out.
