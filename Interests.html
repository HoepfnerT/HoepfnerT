                    As an avid chess enthusiast and player, I have developed a deep passion for the game.
                    While my recent focus has been on online play, I have a rich background in tournament chess.
                    During my youth, I achieved considerable success at the national level,
                    including my victory at the Hesse State Championship in 2008, in the under 12 age group.
                    Additionally, in 2012, I secured a commendable sixth place in the open part of the German National Championship under 25.
                    You can explore my FIDE profile for more details on my chess journey:

                    I draw inspiration from remarkable chess players, particularly world champion Ding Liren and the talented Levon Aronian.
                    Among the countless memorable games, Nigel Short's triumphant encounter against Jan Timman in 1991 holds a special place in my heart.
                    It features one of the most beautiful and creative attacks in chess history.

                    While chess holds a prominent position in my gaming repertoire,
                    I also derive great enjoyment from other competitive games.
                    For instance, I love engaging in thrilling matches of the card game Dominion or delving into the strategic world of Settlers of Catan, a captivating board game.
                    Of course, it's important to note that games serve not only as a platform for competition but also as a source of pure fun and entertainment.
                    I relish the social dynamics of board game evenings and cherish the immersive experiences offered by tabletop games like Dungeons & Dragons.

                    My favorite mathematical puzzle is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_prisoners_problem">100 prisoners problem</a>
                    <button id="btn-modal-prisoners">(show)</button>.
                    <dialog id="modal-prisoners">
                        <div style="width:50vw">

                                The director of a prison offers 100 death row prisoners,
                                who are numbered from 1 to 100, a last chance.
                                A room contains a cupboard with 100 drawers.
                                The director randomly puts one prisoner's number in each closed drawer.
                                The prisoners enter the room, one after another. Each prisoner may open and look into 50 drawers in any order.
                                The drawers are closed again afterwards. If, during this search, every prisoner finds their number in one of the drawers,
                                all prisoners are pardoned. If even one prisoner does not find their number, all prisoners die.
                                Before the first prisoner enters the room, the prisoners may discuss strategy — but may not communicate once the first prisoner enters to look in the drawers.
                                What is the prisoners' best strategy? <br />
                                (Version due to P. Flajolet and R. Sedgewick.)

                    Originally proposed by P. B. Miltersen as a problem with no good solution, it turns out that there is a surprising solution that seems to good to be true.
                    Working this out leads you on a surprising journey through the world of stochastics, discrete mathematics, graph theory and information theory.
                    This problem is also a great way to introduce people to research mathematics.
                    For example, I used this problem during the propaedeutic for all incoming students, working out the solution step by step with the pupils.
                    If you just want to see the solution, I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSNsgj1OCLA">this video by Veritasium on youtube</a>, though, have a go at it yourself first!
